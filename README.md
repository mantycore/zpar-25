# Zpär-25
## Introduction
Zpär-25 is one of the Zpär family of languages, brought by dreamhackers and psychonauts from the depths of dream. This is an attempt of a popular introduction to it.

## Oneirotectonics and Notation
The native realization of Zpär-25 is not phonemic; it consists of three quanta of *dream intent*: **C**, **Ɔ**, **Ƨ**, also notated as **0**, **1**, and **2**. However, the most basic semantic unit in Zpär-25 is a *trigram* of these quanta, also called a glyph, or a letter. They are transcribed with Latin letter (chosen to resemble the calligraphic version of trigram glyph) as follows:

| Trigram | Ternary | Latin | Provisional pronunciation | Archetypal meaning |

The need to pronounce came to Zpär-25 third, after the native oneiric realization and the graphic transcription, so its practical pronunciation is very provisional and somewhat awkward. The last glyph in a word always have a vowel (+ coda) realization, and backwards from it there is alternating pattern of vowel/consonant, so all one-glyph words have V structure, two, CV, three, VCV, four, CVCV, etc. The stress, if needed, falls on the first long syllable, on on the last one if there are no long vowels. Some examples:

**n** /ˈan/<br>
**a** /ˈa:/<br>
**kr** /ˈkar/<br>
**uo** /ˈwoː/<br>
**hy** /ˈhyː/<br>
**løø** /alˈʝʷøː/<br>
**adt** /ˈaːdot/<br>
**txu** /etˈʃuː/<br>
**equ** /ˈeːtʃuː/<br>
**tsi** /etˈsiː/<br>
**eci** /ˈeːtsiː/<br>
**yddi** /ɥadˈdiː/<br>
**atkh** /ʕotˈkoh/<br>
**whhf** /ɰohˈhof/<br>
**dnat** /danˈʕot/<br>
**ojkhr** /ˈoːʒokhar/<br>
**clqde** /estleʃtˈdeː/ (it can be safely assimilated into /estleʒdˈdeː/<br>

## Morphology

Each sequence of glyphs is a valid word. The morphology is self-segregating with the length of the word indicating part of speech:

- 1 glyph: microcode particle: syntax linearization;
- 2 glyphs: relational: syntax relations;
- 3 glyphs: contentive (content word, root word): semantic content and most of grammatical categories;
  - 5+ glyphs: personal names and rare special terms.

The meaning of the word depends on the meaning of all ordered pairs (not only consecutive ones) of glyphs in it, e.g. **adt** is based on meanings of **a.d**, **a.t**, and **d.t**.

## Syntax
### Content words and content phrases

Content words are closest in meaning to adjectives and adverbs in natural languages. Several content words in a sequence form a content phrase; they are all coreferent. The meaning of the content phrase is called a referent (it is closer to discourse referent, or intensional): it is something that is described by all content words in the phrase.

The semantic fields of Zpär-25 are very broad and fuzzy compared to human languages; e.g. **adt** “feline” can mean anything related to cats, real, imaginary, or metaphorical. It can be made more precise by using longer words, and/or by combining several contentives into a phrase.

Approaching Zpär-25 from the perspective of human languages, we can identify clause-like referents (events, processes), noun-like referents (process participants - which themselves can be processes), and verb-like referents (abstract event/process templates or schemas). However, the distinction is very permeable in Zpär-25: e.g. **rbo ofc** can be translated as “to fly swiftly”, “a swift flight”, or “something flying swiftly”.

As a special case, an empty text is treated as an empty content phrase with a vague meaning “something”.

### Relationals

Relationals link content phrases together. A relational occurs between two content phrases, one to the left and one to the right, and gives them distinct roles in the relationship. Many relationals describe the relationship between an event and its participants; they function like the prepositions indicating the thematic relations of participant phrases in a clause. These relationals treat their left content phrase as a event and their right, as a event participant:

*jcc hy hjd* “It is raining in the distance.”

### Microcode particles

Natively, Zpär-25 text can be conceptualized as a graph; microcode particles help to express the graph linearly in a manner similar to human languages. There are several particles, each with its own function and syntax, but generally they can be divided into those with content-like syntax and those with relational-like one.


#### Contentive-like particles

**a, e, i, o, ø, u** just tag the current referrent. They are used in pronoun-like manner with the following particle **l** to easily recall the already-mentioned referrents. If the narrative is very complex, the combinations of three tags give total of 20 unique references. 

**l** takes the content words (and aforementioned tags) added in the current content phrase so far, and identify the current referrent with the most recently mentioned referrent having all these contentives and/or tags. It functions like a definitive article in function of anaphoric reference.

*uo adt n old my zdp n un uo lzd n old my adt l* “A cat likes to play, while I like the *(recently mentioned)* cat”

**m** allows to draw two (or more) relationals at once sharing both left side and the right side:

*oau uo øbm n my sfn k kr m ad ryb hy hjp* “A poet sees a dragon which is slighering across a meadow”

Here, **ryb** “slither” is connected to **sfn** “dragon” both through **k kr** (the dragon is the agent in the event of slithering) and by **ad** (the dragon is described by this event of slithering). 

#### Relational-like particles

**n** returns backward to the referent before the most recent relational. It is very useful in laying out a clause structure:

*ieu kr øoz n nu vug n sø yddi* “I am giving her a sushi.”

Here, we return to the referent of **ieu** “give” after describing each of the participant of the process (except the last one).

**p** creates a new referent and copies the previous relational with the original left side and the newly created referent as the right side:

*ieu kr øoz n nu vug n sø yddi p jeei p pqku* “I am giving her a sushi, soy sauce, and wasabi.”

**w** creates a new referent, so far completely disconnected from the previous graph. Usually, though, it is then either connected or identified with already-existing referents.

**k** inverts the direction of the next relational:

*hjd k hy jcc* “In the distance, there is raining.”

**q** allows to modify the relationship between a content word and its referent, with **b** returning to describing the referent itself:

*dvn q xmm b adt* “An intensely red cat”

**d** does the same to the relational:

*ieu kr d xfx b øoz n nu vug n sø yddi* “Supposedly, it is me who is giving her a sushi.”

**r** precedes a chain of relationals ending with **l** which is used to pattern-match the previously described part of the graph and find the latest matching referent:

*pd uvh rmb p mnn n k kr pzd cfl sø vfq k ko ihn mfh sh r kr l* “The North Wind and The Sun were arguing about which of them was the strongest.”

Here, *r kr k* is used to select the agent/subject (**kr**) of the previous clause (that is, “The North Wind and The Sun”): the pronominal meaning which in English is translated as “them”.
